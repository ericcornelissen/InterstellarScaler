# InterstellarScaler
An easy and simple to use web application that will calculate what you'll weigh on other planets in our solarsystem!

Just fill in your weight in the inputbox of the web application, click on 'Explore!' and find out what you'll weigh on other planets in our solar system like mars or saturn and even the sun. Visit the application via this link: [InterstellarScaler](https://ericcornelissen.github.io/InterstellarScaler/).

## JavaScript Library
If you used this web application and thought to yourself: "Wow, that was cool!" And you want to create something like this by yourself, you might consider using a JavaScript library I wrote that will do the calculations of this InterstellarScaler. The library is easy to use (as shown below), and if you want to use it you can find it [here](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/InterstellarScaler-Library).

```JavaScript
_IS_convertWeight(10, "earth", "mars"); // Converts 10 kg on earth to 3.77 kg on mars.
```
